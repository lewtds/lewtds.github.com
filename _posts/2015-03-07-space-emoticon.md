title: Why I always put a space in the middle of emoticons

If you are my friend or have seen some of my less formal writing, then
you would probably have seen me making smiley faces like this **: ))**
instead of this **:))**.

This was born out of my frustration with the inconsistency in
rendering emoticons across big chat services like Yahoo and Skype and
Facebook.  The **=)** icon used to make a laughing face in Facebook,
before they totally butchered it by making it look just like the
**:)** icon, which means, if you've not been living under a rock,
something a world apart.  Facebook's iconic cat face **:3** actually
renders a black cat in Skype.  Fed up with this, I decided to always
place a space in there to force chat services to preserve what I want
to express.  After all, plain text is still the most consistent means
of communication.

To quote [Graydon Hoare](http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/193447.html):
