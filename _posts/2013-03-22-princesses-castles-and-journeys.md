Most things in the world are consequences of consequences of consequences. I 
guess that's how the story begins.

When I was a little child, I was able to notice how different I am from other 
kids my age. Instead of running wild on the streets, I spend time with my toy 
box, breaking things down then joining them together, trying, experimenting 
with how things work. I was what some people may call a born geek.

Then I went to school, made new friends and started to find girls attractive.As 
a kid who was itching to get noticed, I tried numerous ways to make myself 
visible to girls. The smart kid gets the girls, they say. I started writing 
tales of gorgeous ladies and honorable knights in a lords-and-dragons-filled 
world. All of the fairy tales that I'd read suddenly came so handy as they 
morphed, blossomed and manifested themselves in my little creative process. I 
was so proud of it. But ultimately, my plan failed and with it went all my 
enthusiasm for writing. For long, writing has been a nightmare for me 
throughout schooldays. I had to crawl in the rules, structures and ideas people 
try to implant in my mind. Almost anything I wrote is met with criticism and I 
became afraid of articulating words.

So I decided to stop writing anything at all and focus all my energy into what 
I am good at the most: engineering. For a while, my appetite for knowledge has 
been amply fed as I skim, dig, crunch through all the wiki pages and 
programmer's guides I can find. All hard, dry and solid. I lock and content 
myself in this digital life of mine thinking that's all I'll ever need in life 
and that people writing long, thought-provoking posts are nothing but 
fame-craving wretches.

Over the time, this has taken an unhealthy toll on my personal life. The most 
horrifying moment was when I had a fight with my girlfriend, who majors in 
literature, unfortunately. She wrote a lengthy email expressing her concerns 
and disappointment in me. And I can only sit there, stuck wordless as all these 
years of aversion and procrastination sum up in this single moment. I didn't 
write back. Even if I had, what she received would only have been broken, 
stuttered sentence fragments. Luckily, we didn't break up. But I fear we would 
soon if I didn't have the guts to change myself.

So, princesses, castles and journeys then. It's still the same thing I once 
took pride in, just now in a different light.
